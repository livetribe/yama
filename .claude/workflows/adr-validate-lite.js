const PRECHECK_PROMPT = `${ROOT_NOTE} Read the ADR in full. This is a purely mechanical fact-check, not a judgment call: grep the file for every occurrence of "ADR-" followed by three digits. For each one, confirm whether a file matching that number exists in the same directory as this ADR. Report a finding only for a reference to an ADR number with no matching file, or a number higher than the current file's own number (a forward reference to a decision that has not been written). Do not report anything else — this check is scoped to ADR-number existence only, not to whether the citation is appropriate. For each finding, give gate: "Self-Containment", the summary, exact location, a short quote, and why_it_matters (state that a forward or nonexistent reference cannot be verified by a reader today).`

Flag: any claim that does not check out against what you find, any claim presented as fact or history with no verifiable source, and any "rejected alternative" that reads as invented rather than something that actually happened in this project's code, docs, or history. State exactly what you checked each claim against. Tag every finding gate: "Evidence". For each finding, give the summary, exact location, a short quote, and why it matters.`,

Flag any claim in the body that the document's own Non-Goals section says is out of scope for this ADR. Tag every finding gate: "Consistency".

  },
  {
    key: 'structure',
    prompt: `${ROOT_NOTE} Read the ADR in full. Check two separate things. Do NOT check whether cited ADR numbers exist — that is handled elsewhere.

First, self-containment (tag findings here gate: "Self-Containment") — this ADR must stand on its own. For every citation in the document to another document (any file, ticket, note, or artifact that is not itself an ADR in the same directory), ask: is this offered as evidence the decision is correct, or as a description of what results from the decision? Citing another document's current wording as support for the decision is always a finding, because that document's content can change independently of this ADR without anyone revisiting it — a reader has no way to tell from the ADR alone that the citation has drifted. Stating that something in another document is a downstream consequence of this decision is fine and not a finding.

Second, structural soundness (tag findings here gate: "Structure") — a subsection whose heading claims an argument (e.g. "X is cheaper than Y") that its own body never actually makes; a subsection substantially redundant with another subsection, restating a point already made elsewhere without adding anything new; a property presented as if specific to this decision when it is actually a general property of every ADR in this project (check for a README or conventions file in the same directory as this ADR, and read its stated conventions before flagging this); a claim in one section undercut or contradicted by another section.

For each finding, give the gate, summary, exact location, a short quote, and why it matters (for self-containment findings, why_it_matters should state what happens if the cited document's content changes or is never written).`,
